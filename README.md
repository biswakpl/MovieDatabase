# MovieDatabase

Udacity Full Stack Developer Nanodegree Project 1 solution: to create a site on movies.
This is a database of my favorite romantic movies. When run, this launches a browser displaying a list of movies with their titles and logos. Clicking a logo opens a window to play the youtube trailer for that movie.

# How to Use

1. Make sure you have python installed in your computer
2. Clone the github directory (https://github.com/biswakpl/MovieDatabase.git) or Download the contents
3. Run fresh_tomatoes.py
4. Click the logo of any movie to open the trailer in a small window

# How does it work

We have 3 files in total:

###movie_db.csv: 
This csv file contains all the movie info (Name, Details, logo URL, Youtube trailer URL). You can add more if you want
###fresh_tomatoes.py: 
This is the python file which contains the HTML and CSS code and the initialization of movie objects
###Movie_Class.py: 
This python file contains the code for the Movie class
